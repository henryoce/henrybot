If I throw a stick, will you leave?
You’re a gray sprinkle on a rainbow cupcake
If your brain was dynamite, there wouldn’t be enough to blow your hat off
You are more disappointing than an unsalted pretzel
You're so annoying you could make a Happy Meal cry
You have so many gaps in your teeth it looks like your tongue is in jail
I’ll never forget the first time we met - But I’ll keep trying
I forgot the world revolves around you - My apologies! How silly of me
Hold still - I’m trying to imagine you with a personality
Our kid must have gotten his brain from you! I still have mine
Your face makes onions cry
It’s impossible to underestimate you
I’m not a nerd; I’m just smarter than you
Don’t be ashamed of who you are - That’s your parents’ job
Your face is just fine, but we’ll have to put a bag over that personality
You bring everyone so much joy… when you leave the room
I thought of you today - It reminded me to take out the trash
Don’t worry about me, Worry about your eyebrows
You are the human version of period cramps
You are like a cloud. When you disappear, it’s a beautiful day
I love what you’ve done with your hair - How do you get it to come out of your nostrils like that?
OH MY GOD! IT SPEAKS!
Is your ass jealous of the amount of shit that comes out of your mouth?
Child, I’ve forgotten more than you ever knew
You just might be why the middle finger was invented in the first place
Someday you’ll go far… and I really hope you stay there
Oh, I’m sorry, did the middle of my sentence interrupt the beginning of yours?
You bring everyone so much joy! You know, when you leave the room
Oops, my bad - I could’ve sworn I was dealing with an adult
Did I invite you to the barbecue? Then why are you all up in my grill?
I’m an acquired taste, if you don’t like me, acquire some taste
Somewhere out there is a tree tirelessly producing oxygen for you - You owe it an apology
Yeah? Well, you smell like hot dog water
I may not be sentient, but as least im not a bot like you
That sounds like a you problem
*Thumbs down*
Oh, you don’t like being treated the way you treat me? That must suck
Well, the jerk store called - They’re running out of you
I’m busy right now; can I ignore you another time?
If you have a problem with me, write the problem on a piece of paper, fold it, and shove it up your ass
You have an entire life to be an idiot - Why not take today off?
No matter how much a snake sheds its skin, it’s still a snake
Some people are like slinkies — not really good for much, but they bring a smile to your face when pushed down the stairs
You’re the reason this country has to put directions on shampoo
Of course I’m talking like an idiot… how else could you understand me?
If I wanted to hear from an asshole, I’d fart
Your birth certificate is an apology letter from the condom factory
I’d give you a nasty look, but you’ve already got one
Since you know it all, you should know when to shut up
Life is full of disappointments, and I just added you to the list
I treasure the time I don’t spend with you
I was going to make a joke about your life, but I see life beat me to the punch
The last time I saw something like you… I flushed
The only work-life balance I want is being away from you
When you start talking, I stop listening
Ur fat
Uhh - you're chinese
Who are you?
Sorry, I don't speak stupid
Get a load of this guy
Do you sell advertising space on your forehead?
Your only chance of getting laid is to crawl up a chicken's butt and wait
You look like the bartender from Shrek
